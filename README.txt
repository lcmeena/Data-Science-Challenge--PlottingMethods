This python file finds the least used frequency in the FreqInfo.csv file, displays it as a scatter plot, 
and draws a plot line through the average locations of every scatter point. FreqInfo.csv contains the time (in miliseconds), 
amplitude, and corresponding frequency. Time is the x-value of the scatter plot while amplitude is the y-value.
